## Introduction ##

JCard kit is a solution for Java Card development, supporting developers using Eclipse with supported smart cards or simplely using a card simulator.

## Motivation ##

  * The Java Card developer must know the Java Card version 2.x, present in most of the market, even with all facilities of version 3.x.

  * Developers do not have accessible mature tools for Java Card development.

  * Configuring test environment (simulator) is a tedious task that discourages new Java Card developers withou real smart cards

## Propose ##

Support the developer during coding, testing and deploy on real smart cards or EEPROM mask of a simulator, in a simple and intuitive way, so that the developer move to focus its effort in the source code.

JCard offer a kit of tools such as:

  * Wizards for creating a wide variety of types of applets, configuring AID, libraries (JRE version)

  * "Run" with target simulator (with the possibility of saving the mask of the EEPROM after the execution) or actual real cards compatible with the GlobalPlatform specification.

## Features ##

JCard Kit is still under requirement definition.
